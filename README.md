## What Makes Amibot-tg Different?

- Interactive and easy-to-use interface: Amibot-tg provides a simple and intuitive interface on Telegram, allowing you to access your information with just a few taps.
- Since Amibot-tg uses Telegram, you can see previously queried information even when you are offline.
- No need to install an additional app: Unlike other solutions, Amibot-tg does not require you to install a separate app on your device. You can simply use the Telegram app that you already have installed.
- Lightweight and efficient: Amibot-tg uses a textual format for data, requiring less bandwidth and making it more efficient than other solutions. It will even work on slow internet connections!
- Open-source: Review the code, contribute to the project, or even host your own instance.
